    The splittingPolicy object is used to determine if a given point in 2-dimensional space(xCoord, yCoord) is within a radial area measured from the center (0,0).
    An openingDegree and a closingDegree parameter split the 2-dimensional space clockwise in a radial area, a so called splittingPolicy.
    If a given point is within this area then this point is a feasible point for this splittingPolicy.

    measured from the center point (0,0) is a feasible point. 

    An optional excludePolicy parameter defines another radial area which might overlap with the previous area: at those overlaps
    a point is NOT feasible (the point is excluded, hence the name).
